At PMR Data Consulting, we specialize in hands-on data quality assessment. We start by engaging with you to understand your data landscapeâ€”what you have, how you use it, and what you plan to achieve with it. From there, we identify the highest-value data and dive deep into the details, uncovering issues, inconsistencies, and gaps. After thorough investigation, we present our findings, discuss them with you, and provide actionable recommendations to not only fix existing problems but also to prevent them from recurring in the future. Our goal is to ensure your data is clean, reliable, and ready to fuel your business success.

We've tackled many complex data challenges in the past. For instance, we uncovered instances where internet packet sizes were actually mislabeled as timestamps, skewing estimates of internet traffic on a web site. In another case, we found that when a system couldn't find a valid value to write to a database, it simply copied the previous value, causing significant data inaccuracies. We've also addressed issues like inconsistent spelling of data items, which led to suboptimal groupings and flawed models. These are just a few examples of how we dig deep into your data to uncover hidden issues and drive real improvements.

In the example below, we plot daily unit sales figures. Attempts to predict sales based on this data may prove difficult if the anomalies in the data are not addressed.
