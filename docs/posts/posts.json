In 2015 there were more lapsed donors than new donors for the first time.\nAlthough the details of this plot depend on how ‘new donor’ and ‘lapsed donor’ are defined, changing these definitions somewhat has little effect on the conclusion: the donor pool is shrinking.\n\n\n\n",

If this happens, try again later.\n\n\n\n",
