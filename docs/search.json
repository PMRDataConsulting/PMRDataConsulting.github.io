He has extensive real world data\nscience experience with some of the largest technology companies in the\nworld, as well as the theoretical knowledge afforded by a PhD in\nProbability and Statistics. He has co-led Data For Good\nOttawa, a group of volunteer data\nscientists who apply their expertise to solve the problems of local\ncharities. He shares his expertise with MBA students at the University\nof Ottawa, meetup groups, and colleagues.\n\n\nOur approach to data science (click the triangles to see details):\n\nAll real-world data sets contain anomalies.\nIt is the job of the data scientist to ensure that anomalies are caught,\nmitigated, and most importantly, that their impact is understood by\nstakeholders before business decisions are made.\nAnomalies may be data entry errors, coding errors, or some facet of your business that you do not yet understand.\nThe important question is “what do the anomalies mean to your business’ bottom line?”\n\nUsing just one number to describe any real-world scenario is\nmisleading.\nYour business is too complex to be captured by just one metric. You also\nneed to know a likely range for the metric (eg. a confidence interval),\nand how this metric interacts with other metrics.\n\nData insights must speak the language of your business, or their value\nmay be lost.\nIf these insights aren’t expressed in terms that resonate with business objectives and decision making processes, their potential to drive meaningful action and create value may be diminished.\nGuided by these principles, PMR Data Consulting specializes in\nhelping businesses, large and small, extract the most important insights from their data.\n\n\n\n",

      "contents": "\n\n\n\nIntroduction\nImagine you run a small coffee shop, and are looking at sales figures and expenses and worrying that you may run low on cash in the next 12 weeks.\n\n\n\nHere is a plot of your sales by week for the past year.\n\n\n\nYour expenses are somewhat spikey, as utilities, rent and labour come at regular intervals, but we’ll assume that materials expenses come more or less continuously and are related to sales: if you sell more your raw materials costs are more. So we can only figure out your expenses once we know how much you will sell.\nSo, we need to forecast your sales for the next 12 weeks.\n\n\n\nThe black points are your historical sales. The solid black line is the (average) forecast, and the gray ‘ribbon’ bounds the likely range of sales for the forecast.\nLets first look at expenses under the assumption of the average forecast.\n\n\n\nLet plot them both\n\n\n\nYou’d want to know if the spikes in expenses are covered by the steadier sales, so let look at the cumulative difference - in other words if yous tarted with a bank balance of zero, what would your bank balance look like?\n\n\n\nThis shows that your sales would more than cover your expenses.\nBut, recall that this is based on a sales forecast, and forecasts are probabilistic statements, not certainty. So lets repeat the above, but now assuming the most pessimistic of sales forecasts\n\n\n\nHere we see that we’d be in trouble by week 9. If we started off with a bank balance of 10k, we’d be fine, but if it is less than that we’d need to arrange to pay some expenses later, or collect on our sales sooner, or failing that access a line of credit.\nCash management is a critical component of any business, and being able to predict your sales and expenses can allow you to avoid the worst.\n\n\n\n",

      "author": [],
      "contents": "\nChallenge\nThis organization was concerned about their shrinking donations.\nInitial analysis suggested that although the donations per donor were steady, that perhaps the donor base was shrinking.\nApproach\nWe looked at the size of the pool of donors, and grouped them into categories of new and lapsed. (Note the definitions of new and lapsed were varied with little effect on the results.)\nA plot of the cumulative number of each group confirms the suspicion.\n\n\n\nIn the early 2000’s, there were many more new donors than lapsed donors. But as we progress we find that there are fewer new donors and more lapsed donors each year. In 2015 there were more lapsed donors than new donors for the first time. The conclusion is that the donor pool is shrinking.\nOutcomes\nThe important insight that the donor pool was shrinking allowed the organization to focus its efforts on finding strategies to improve in three areas: acquiring more new donors, recapturing lapsed donors, and preventing donors from lapsing.\nSimilar techniques can be applied to your business to provide you with the information you’ll need to adapt your strategy to your customers’ behaviours. We can perform a customer lifetime value (CLV) analysis that can help you assess the value of each customer to your business over the long term, or a churn analysis that looks at how customers’ behaviour evolves over time.\n\n\n\n",

      "contents": "\nAt PMR Data Consulting, we specialize in hands-on data quality assessment. We start by engaging with you to understand your data landscape—what you have, how you use it, and what you plan to achieve with it. From there, we identify the highest-value data and dive deep into the details, uncovering issues, inconsistencies, and gaps. After thorough investigation, we present our findings, discuss them with you, and provide actionable recommendations to not only fix existing problems but also to prevent them from recurring in the future. Our goal is to ensure your data is clean, reliable, and ready to fuel your business success.\nWe’ve tackled many complex data challenges in the past. For instance, we uncovered instances where internet packet sizes were actually mislabeled as timestamps, skewing estimates of internet traffic on a web site. In another case, we found that when a system couldn’t find a valid value to write to a database, it simply copied the previous value, causing significant data inaccuracies. We’ve also addressed issues like inconsistent spelling of data items, which led to suboptimal groupings and flawed models. These are just a few examples of how we dig deep into your data to uncover hidden issues and drive real improvements.\n\nAttempts to predict daily sales based on this data may prove difficult if the anomalies in the data are not addressed\n\n\n",

      "contents": "\n\n\n\nChallenge\nImagine you run a small coffee shop, and are looking at daily sales figures for July 2022 through October 2023. The sales figures are shown in the following plot. The challenge is to understand the impact of different factors on your sales.\n\n\n\nOverall we see a slight trend upwards, but there are some spikes around March 2023. Lets zoom in to see more detail:\n\n\n\nThere is one low value in the first half of February, and then an increase in mid-March, then a sharp decline in early April, and then a continuation of the previous trend in later April.\nSo what happened?\nApproach\nWe looked at the sales figures by day, as well as what was going on in the coffee shop’s immediate environment.\nA neighboring coffee shop, a competitor, shut down for renovations on February 14, and reopened March 24. Lets indicate those dates on the overall plot so we can see what changed.\n\n\n\nWhat we’d like to know is:\n- the impact on sales during the competitor’s shutdown, and\n- the impact on sales of them reopening.\nWhat happened while the competitor was shut down?\nIn the plots above we saw an increase of sales while the competitor was shut down for renovations - can we estimate how their shutdown increased sales?\nThis is a bit tricky, and we can’t just compare sales the week (or any other time window) before the shutdown to the week of the shutdown because perhaps there are some seasonal effects (eg people buy more coffee around Valentines day) that need to be accounted for.\nSo we use a technique that, in essence, predicts what would have happened based on historical data and then compares it to what actually happened. This is illustrated in the following plot\nUp until the competitor shut down, the difference between what we predict and what actually happened is zero. But then we see a change after the competitor shuts down. We show the cumulative effect, i.e. the total amount of sales estimated as a result of their shutting down, and we see that by the end of their shutdown the coffee shop has made an additional 12k or so over what would have been expected if the competitor had stayed open.\nThe prediction intervals (in gray) show the range of likely values. At the end of the shutdown our best single estimate is that the coffee shop made an additional 12k, but that could actually be anywhere between 8k and 15k. (All good statistical results will provide a range of values, not just a single figure, so that you can assess alternate scenarios)\n\n\n\nIn summary, during the period the competitor shut down, the coffee shop made more money than would have been expected otherwise.\nWhat happened after they reopened?\nWe’d also like to know what happened after the competitor reopened. A similar analysis procedure yields the following plot.\n\n\n\nIn this time window it looks like there was an overall cumulative increase in sales of approximately 8k by the end of the data period in mid-October.\nIt is interesting in that there is an initial decline in the cumulative sales. Perhaps customers from both shops decided to give the renovated shop a try.\nThen the sales pick up again: the shop’s customers returned, along with newly acquired customers from the competitor.\nBy Sept 1st the sales are back to what would have been expected, and then they increase due to the newly acquired customers.\nBased on this data, and all the assumptions made in the analysis, the competitor closing for renovations increased overall sales.\nOutcomes\nAnalyzing the sales data helped the coffee shop understand the impact of an external event on their sales, allowing them to better estimate future sales and plan accordingly.\nSimilar techniques can be applied to your business to estimate the impact of sales promotions, advertising campaigns, or even the release of new products on your profits.\n\n\n\n",
