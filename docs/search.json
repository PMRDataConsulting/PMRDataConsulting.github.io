      "contents": "\nPeter Rabinovitch\nis the founder of PMR Data Consulting. He has extensive real world data\nscience experience with some of the largest technology companies in the\nworld, as well as a PhD in Probability and Statistics.\nHe has co-lead Data For Good Ottawa, a\ngroup of volunteer data scientists who apply their expertise to solving\nthe problems of local charities.\nHe teaches data science to MBA students at University of Ottawa.\n\n\n\nThese experiences have shaped his approach to data science:\n\nAll real-world data sets contain anomalies\nThey may be data entry errors, coding errors, or some facet of your\nbusiness that you do not yet understand.\nThe important question is what do they mean to my business?\nHow can you modify the data entry procedure to eliminate the\nerrors?\nWhat code need to be changed and how can you prevent similar\nerrors from happening again\nWhat insights are they clues to?\n\nEven the best data sets contain anomalies, and it is the job of the\ndata scientist to ensure that they are caught, mitigated, and most\nimportantly, that the impact of any such anomalies is understood by\nstakeholders before business decisions are made.\n\nUsing just one number to describe any real-world scenario\nmisses the point\nAny non-trivial problem is too complicated to be captured bu just one\nmetric. One also need to know a likely range for the metric (eg. a\nconfidence interval), and how this metric interacts with other metrics.\nFor example would you prefer to make a decision on staring a project\nknowing just the average ROI, or would you prefer to know the range\nof likely ROIs the project would generate?\n\nData science IS communication\nIt is not enough to do statistics, machine learning, etc. The results\nmust be communicated to stakeholders in their language in such a way\nthat the implications of the data science work are clear, or the project\nwill have no business impact, as people will not base decisions on what\nthey don’t understand.\nGuided by these principles, PMR Data Consulting specializes in\nhelping businesses extract the most useful insights from their data.\n\n\n\n",
