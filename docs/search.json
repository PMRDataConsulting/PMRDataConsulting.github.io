      "contents": "\nPeter Rabinovitch\nis the founder of PMR Data Consulting. He has extensive real world data\nscience experience with some of the largest technology companies in the\nworld, as well as the theoretical knowledge afforded by a PhD in\nProbability and Statistics. He has co-led Data For Good\nOttawa, a group of volunteer data\nscientists who apply their expertise to solve the problems of local\ncharities. He shares his expertise with MBA students at the University\nof Ottawa, meetup groups, and colleagues.\n\n\nOur approach to data science (click the triangles to see details):\n\nAll real-world data sets contain anomalies\nIt is the job of the data scientist to ensure that anomalies are caught,\nmitigated, and most importantly, that their impact is understood by\nstakeholders before business decisions are made.\nAnomalies may be data entry errors, coding errors, or some facet of your business that you do not yet understand.\nThe important question is “what do the anomalies mean to your business’s bottom line?”\n\nUsing just one number to describe any real-world scenario is\nmisleading\nYour business is too complex to be captured by just one metric. You also\nneed to know a likely range for the metric (eg. a confidence interval),\nand how this metric interacts with other metrics.\n\nData insights must speak the language of your business, or their value\nmay be lost\nIf these insights aren’t expressed in terms that resonate with business objectives and decision making processes, their potential to drive meaningful action and create value may be diminished.\nGuided by these principles, PMR Data Consulting specializes in\nhelping businesses, large and small, extract the most important insights from their data.\n\n\n\n",

      "description": "Analyzing the size of a donor base over time",
      "author": [],
      "contents": "\nIn this project, the organization was concerned about their shrinking donations.\nInitial analysis suggested that although the donations per donor were steady, that perhaps the donor base was shrinking.\nFurther analysis looked at the size of the pool of donors, and grouped them into categories of ‘new’ and ‘lapsed’.\nA plot of the cumulative number of each group confirms the suspicion.\n\n\n\nIn the early 2000’s, there were many more new donors than lapsed donors. But as we progress we find that there are fewer new donors and more lapsed donors each year. In 2015 there were more lapsed donors than new donors for the first time.\nAlthough the details of this plot depend on how ‘new donor’ and ‘lapsed donor’ are defined, changing these definitions somewhat has little effect on the conclusion: the donor pool is shrinking.\nThis finding allowed the organization to focus its efforts in three areas:\nacquiring more new donors,\nrecapturing lapsed donors,\npreventing donors from lapsing\nWe can also perform customer lifetime value (CLV) analyses that can help you assess the value of each customer to your business over the long term.\n\n\n\n",

      "author": [],
      "contents": "\nBefore starting on any statistical analysis, it is important to know the quality of the data upon which the analysis will be based. We can perform a data quality assessment that provides overall assessments and recommendations for improving data quality.\nData quality is a continuum. The quality of a data set must be assessed with respect to its intended use, and the potential impact of any results derived from the data.\n\nIn the example above, we plot daily unit sales figures. Attempts to predict sales based on this data may prove difficult if the anomalies in the data are not addressed.\n\n\n\n",

      "contents": "\nForecasts of sales, costs, and cash flow are essential tools for your business planning.\nForecasts should always include an indication of the uncertainty in the predictions (shown in green below) so that you can plan for each likely outcome. Think of forecasts as possible futures, from which you can assess different business outcomes and make decisions based on their likelihoods.\n\nForecasts can be done for your business to understand demand, costs, or any other metrics.\nWe can also perform impact analyses that help determine the effect of an intervention on any metric, for example the impact of an advertising campaign on your sales.\n\n\n\n",

      "contents": "\nThis project, for the Ottawa Food Bank, had the goal of understanding demand for different types of food in the different Ottawa wards, over time.\nWe built a custom app to aid with this task. One of the most interesting insights found was that the Ottawa Food Bank was providing diapers for one-fifth of the two month old babies in the Rideau Vanier ward. This statement could then be used in showing donors the huge impact they were having in the community.\n\nSimilar analyses can be done for any business to understand demand for its products.\n\n\n\n",
