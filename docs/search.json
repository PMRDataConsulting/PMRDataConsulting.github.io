      "contents": "\nPeter Rabinovitch\nis the founder of PMR Data Consulting. He has extensive real world data\nscience experience with some of the largest technology companies in the\nworld, as well as the theoretical knowledge afforded by a PhD in\nProbability and Statistics. He has co-led Data For Good\nOttawa, a group of volunteer data\nscientists who apply their expertise to solve the problems of local\ncharities. He shares his expertise with MBA students at the University\nof Ottawa, meetup groups, and colleagues.\n\n\nOur approach to data science (click the triangles to see details):\n\nAll real-world data sets contain anomalies\nIt is the job of the data scientist to ensure that anomalies are caught,\nmitigated, and most importantly, that their impact is understood by\nstakeholders before business decisions are made.\nAnomalies may be data entry errors, coding errors, or some facet of your business that you do not yet understand.\nThe important question is “what do the anomalies mean to your business’s bottom line?”\n\nUsing just one number to describe any real-world scenario is\nmisleading\nYour business is too complex to be captured by just one metric. You also\nneed to know a likely range for the metric (eg. a confidence interval),\nand how this metric interacts with other metrics.\n\nData insights must speak the language of your business, or their value\nmay be lost\nIf these insights aren’t expressed in terms that resonate with business objectives and decision making processes, their potential to drive meaningful action and create value may be diminished.\nGuided by these principles, PMR Data Consulting specializes in\nhelping businesses, large and small, extract the most important insights from their data.\n\n\n\n",
