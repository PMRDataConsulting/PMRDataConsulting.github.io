      "contents": "\nPeter Rabinovitch\nis the founder of PMR Data Consulting. He has extensive real world data\nscience experience with some of the largest technology companies in the\nworld, as well as the theoretical knowledge afforded by a PhD in\nProbability and Statistics. He has co-lead Data For Good\nOttawa, a group of volunteer data\nscientists who apply their expertise to solving the problems of local\ncharities. He shares his expertise with MBA students at the University\nof Ottawa, meetup groups, and colleagues.\n\n\nOur approach to data science (click the triangles to see details):\n\nAll real-world data sets contain anomalies\nIt is the job of the data scientist to ensure that anomalies are caught,\nmitigated, and most importantly, that their impact is understood by\nstakeholders before business decisions are made.\nAnomalies may be data entry errors, coding errors, or some facet of your business that you do not yet understand.\nThe important question is “what do the anomalies mean to your business’s bottom line?”\n\nUsing just one number to describe any real-world scenario is\nmisleading\nYour business is too complex to be captured by just one metric. You also\nneed to know a likely range for the metric (eg. a confidence interval),\nand how this metric interacts with other metrics.\n\nInsights must be presented in business terms, or their value\nmay be lost\nThe results must be communicated to stakeholders in the language of\ntheir business in such a way that the implications of the data science\nwork is clear, or the project may have no business impact.\nGuided by these principles, PMR Data Consulting specializes in\nhelping businesses extract the most important insights from their data.\n\n\n\n",
