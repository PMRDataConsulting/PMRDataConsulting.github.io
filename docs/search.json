      "contents": "\nPeter Rabinovitch\nis the founder of PMR Data Consulting. He has extensive real world data\nscience experience with some of the largest technology companies in the\nworld, as well as the theoretical knowledge afforded by a PhD in\nProbability and Statistics. He has co-led Data For Good\nOttawa, a group of volunteer data\nscientists who apply their expertise to solve the problems of local\ncharities. He shares his expertise with MBA students at the University\nof Ottawa, meetup groups, and colleagues.\n\n\nOur approach to data science (click the triangles to see details):\n\nAll real-world data sets contain anomalies.\nIt is the job of the data scientist to ensure that anomalies are caught,\nmitigated, and most importantly, that their impact is understood by\nstakeholders before business decisions are made.\nAnomalies may be data entry errors, coding errors, or some facet of your business that you do not yet understand.\nThe important question is “what do the anomalies mean to your business’s bottom line?”\n\nUsing just one number to describe any real-world scenario is\nmisleading.\nYour business is too complex to be captured by just one metric. You also\nneed to know a likely range for the metric (eg. a confidence interval),\nand how this metric interacts with other metrics.\n\nData insights must speak the language of your business, or their value\nmay be lost.\nIf these insights aren’t expressed in terms that resonate with business objectives and decision making processes, their potential to drive meaningful action and create value may be diminished.\nGuided by these principles, PMR Data Consulting specializes in\nhelping businesses, large and small, extract the most important insights from their data.\n\n\n\n",

      "author": [],
      "contents": "\nIn this project, the organization was concerned about their shrinking donations.\nInitial analysis suggested that although the donations per donor were steady, that perhaps the donor base was shrinking.\nFurther analysis looked at the size of the pool of donors, and grouped them into categories of ‘new’ and ‘lapsed’.\nA plot of the cumulative number of each group confirms the suspicion.\n\n\n\nIn the early 2000’s, there were many more new donors than lapsed donors. But as we progress we find that there are fewer new donors and more lapsed donors each year. In 2015 there were more lapsed donors than new donors for the first time.\nAlthough the details of this plot depend on how ‘new donor’ and ‘lapsed donor’ are defined, changing these definitions somewhat has little effect on the conclusion: the donor pool is shrinking.\nThis finding allowed the organization to focus its efforts in three areas:\nacquiring more new donors,\nrecapturing lapsed donors,\npreventing donors from lapsing\nWe can also perform customer lifetime value (CLV) analyses that can help you assess the value of each customer to your business over the long term.\n\n\n\n",

      "description": "An impact analysis",
      "author": [],
      "contents": "\n\n\n\nIntroduction\nImagine you run a small coffee shop, and are looking at daily sales figures for July 2022 through October 2023. The sales figures are shown in the following plot.\n\n\n\nOverall we see a slight trend upwards, but there are some spikes around March 2023. Lets zoom in to see more detail:\n\n\n\nThere is one low value in the first half of February, and then an increase in mid-March, then a sharp decline to early April, and then a continuation of the previous trend in later April.\nSo what happened?\nA neighboring coffee shop, a competitor, shut down for renovations on February 14, and reopened March 24. Lets indicate those dates on the overall plot so we can see what changed.\n\n\n\nWhat we’d like to know is:\n- the impact on sales during the competitors shutdown, and\n- the impact of them reopening.\nWhat happened while the competitor was shut down?\nIn the plots above we saw an increase of sales while our competitor was shut down for renovations - can we estimate how their shutdown increased our sales?\nThis is a bit tricky, and we can’t just compare our sales (say) the week before the shutdown to the week of the shutdown because perhaps there are some seasonal effects (eg people buy more coffee around Valentines day) that need to be accounted for.\nSo we use a technique that, in essence, predicts what would have happened based on historical data and then compares it to what actually happened. This is illustrated in the following plot\nUp until our competitor shut down, the difference between what we predict and what actually happened is zero. But then we see a change after the competitor shuts down. We show the cumulative effect, i.e. the total amount of sales estimated as a result of their shutting down, and we see that by the end of their shutdown we have made an additional 12k or so over what we would have expected to make if they had stayed open.\nThe gray prediction intervals show the range of likely values. At the end of the shutdown out best guess is that we made an additional 12k, but that could actually be anywhere between 8k and 15k. (All good statistical results will provide a range of values, not just a single figure, so that you can assess alternate scenarios)\n\n\n\nWhat happened after they reopened?\nWe’d also like to know what happened after our competitor reopened. A similar analysis procedure yields the following plot.\n\n\n\nIn this time window it looks like we have had an overall cumulative increase in sales of about 8k by the end of the data period in mid-October. But it is also interesting in that there is an initial decline in the cumulative sales - perhaps customers (both ours, and our competitors who came to us when their regular shop was shut down) decided to give the renovated shop a try. And then our sales pick up again (perhaps people liked our coffee even better than the renovated competitor’s) until about Sept 1, when we are back to what we would have expected. And (at least for the next month or so) we have sales that are larger than we would have expected.\nConclusion\nBased on this data, and all the assumptions made in the analysis, our competitor closing for renovations increased our sales overall.\nWe can apply the similar techniques to analyzing your data, to see the impact of sales promotions, advertising campaigns, or even the release of new products.\n\n\n\n",
