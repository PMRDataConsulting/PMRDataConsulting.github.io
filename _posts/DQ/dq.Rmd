Before starting on any statistical analysis, it is important to know  the quality of the data upon which the analysis will be based. We can perform a data quality assessment that provides overall assessments and recommendations for improving data quality. 

Data quality is a continuum. The quality of a data set must be assessed with respect to its intended use, and the potential impact of any results derived from the data.
