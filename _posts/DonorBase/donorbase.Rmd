In the early 2000's, there were many more new donors than lapsed donors. But as we progress we find that there are fewer new donors and more lapsed donors each year. In 2015 there were more lapsed donors than new donors for the first time.

Although the details of this plot depend on how 'new donor' and 'lapsed donor' are defined, changing these definitions somewhat has little effect on the conclusion: the donor pool is shrinking.
