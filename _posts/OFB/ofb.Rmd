D4GO's first project was for the Ottawa Food Bank, with the goal of understanding demand for different types of food in the different Ottawa wards, over time.

One of the most interesting insights found was that the Ottawa Food Bank was **providing diapers for one-fifth of the two month old babies in the Rideau Vanier ward** - quite a huge impact statement!

We discovered this with the aid of a quick app to allow users to zoom in on any food group, geographic area, and date range.

A [simplified version of this app is here](https://prabinov.shinyapps.io/GrocStore/), with fake data.

Note this version is on a limited site:   
- if nobody has used it for a while the app may be 'sleeping' and may take a while to load   
- if the app has been used a lot, if may not load due to the maximum number of sessions. If this happens, try again later.
