Forecasts of sales, costs, and cash flow are an essential tool for business planning.  

Forecasts should always include an indication of the uncertainty in the predictions so that you can plan for each likely outcome. Think of forecasts as possible futures, from which you can assess different business outcomes and make decisions based on their likelihoods.

Forecasts can be done for any business to understand demand, costs, etc.

We can also perform impact analyses that helps determine the effect of an intervention on any metric, for example the impact of an advertising campaign on sales.
