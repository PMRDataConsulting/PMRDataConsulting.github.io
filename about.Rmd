These experiences have shaped his approach to data science:

<details>

<summary>All real-world data sets contain anomalies</summary>

They may be data entry errors, coding errors, or some facet of your
business that you do not yet understand.

-   The important question is what do they mean to my business?

    -   How can you modify the data entry procedure to eliminate the
        errors?

    -   What code need to be changed and how can you prevent similar
        errors from happening again

    -   What insights are they clues to?

-   Even the best data sets contain anomalies, and it is the job of the
    data scientist to ensure that they are caught, mitigated, and most
    importantly, that the impact of any such anomalies is understood by
    stakeholders before business decisions are made.

<summary>Using just one number to describe any real-world scenario
misses the point</summary>

Any non-trivial problem is too complicated to be captured bu just one
metric. One also need to know a likely range for the metric (eg. a
confidence interval), and how this metric interacts with other metrics.

-   For example would you prefer to make a decision on staring a project
    knowing just the average ROI, or would you prefer to know the range
    of likely ROIs the project would generate?

<details>

<summary>Data science IS communication</summary>

It is not enough to do statistics, machine learning, etc. The results
must be communicated to stakeholders in their language in such a way
that the implications of the data science work are clear, or the project
will have no business impact, as people will not base decisions on what
they don't understand.

</details>

Guided by these principles, **PMR Data Consulting** specializes in
helping businesses extract the most useful insights from their data.
