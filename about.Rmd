Our approach to data science (*click the triangles to see details*):

<details>

<summary>All real-world data sets contain anomalies</summary>

It is the job of the data scientist to ensure that anomalies are caught,
mitigated, and most importantly, that their impact is understood by
stakeholders before business decisions are made.

-   Anomalies may be data entry errors,

    -   How can you modify the data entry procedure to prevent the
        errors?

-   Coding errors,

    -   Does code need to be changed to prevent similar errors from
        happening again?

-   Or some facet of your business that you do not yet understand.

    -   What insights are the anomalies clues to?

The important question is "**what do they mean to your business?**"

</details>

<details>

<summary>Using just one number to describe any real-world scenario is
misleading</summary>

Your business is too complex to be captured by just one metric. You also
need to know a likely range for the metric (eg. a confidence interval),
and how this metric interacts with other metrics.

</details>

<details>

<summary>We know that insights must be in business terms, or their value
may be lost </summary>

The results must be communicated to stakeholders in the language of
their business in such a way that the implications of the data science
work is clear, or the project may have no business impact.

</details>

Guided by these principles, **PMR Data Consulting** specializes in
helping businesses extract the most important insights from their data.
