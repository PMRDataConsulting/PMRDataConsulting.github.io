Have a look at [this analysis walk-through](renovations.html) to see how a competitor doing renovations on _their_ shop could affect _your_ sales!



The following examples are specific to each organization, but the ideas are widely applicable, and adaptable to your business:

-   [Impactful insights hidden in demand data](ofb.html)

-   [Forecasts of sales, costs, and cash flow](forecasting.html)

-   [Assessing your data quality](dq.html)

-   [Analyzing the growth of your customer base](donorbase.html)
