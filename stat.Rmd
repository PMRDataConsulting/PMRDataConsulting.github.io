"I was Peter's boss while he was at Viamo where he applied rigour and expertise to each problem. Each time, we ended up with a better decision through his analysis. He’s not afraid to speak the truth, even when it wasn’t what we hoped to hear and he adroitly mixes absolute professionalism with a wry sense of humour. He always explains complex topics (like various branches of statistics) in simple terms and has the patience to help others learn how to think more like a Data Scientist. Everyone who crosses his path is better off and more knowledgeable than before."
